# PiSec
Simple security system to detect when a door has been opened using magnetic sensors and a Raspberry Pi. When the sensor is triggered and the system is armed, it will send an email to the user to alert them.

Includes python code to work with the sensor and Java code for a web app that is used to control the system. The code will not work if tried to run because the access to the database was provided by the University of Twente and after graduating I don't have that access anymore.
