**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I prefer either of the three: Implementer or coordinator.
Implementer, because my perseverance allows me to be focused for long periods of time and achieve good productivity.
Coordinator, because I think I am good with people and I can usually see what they are best at and how to facilitate their skills best. I also think that my time management skills help with this.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
I can work long hours easily and stay focused for a long time. I plan my time so that if the task is supposed to take 1-2 hours, it is done in one sitting. However if it needs more time, it will be done in blocks of 2-3 hours. I try to do my assignments with a day extra in case of wrong estimation or unpredictable circumstances.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
I try to see which task takes most time and prioritize those over the ones that take less time, unless they are urgent.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
Regular meetings and whatsapp. I encourage my teammates to share their progress daily. If working on a personal project I use Trello and Google Calendar. It allows me to see what needs to be done and see my plan for the day. 

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
If we are working on a project we usually select a time when we are all available and just sit in a discord room while doing our own tasks. If a member needs help they ask others in the voice chat and we try to help them.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
I try to understand the idea of the project. What should it do? How should it do that? How will the user orpeate? etc. These questions allow to see the project from different perspectives. To complete the project one needs to see the project from the perspective of all posible users and developers. Once everyone is happe - the product is complete.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
Evaluation is important, but what is more important is communication. There should be a dedicated time when a member can tell others what they like, don't like and how to improve performance and overall mindset. Thats what I did with groups i participated in and the results were successful.
