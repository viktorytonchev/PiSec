**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?

	team worker --- Completer-Finisher
I always have the role of solving problems inside a group, I am a person who always looking for the good of the Team, but also I always try to be fear about work and what should be done that is why I consider that I am a Monitor-Evaluator. Moreover, I always try to be sure that there is no error on what we are doing, and I am concerned with deadlines and always push the member to make their job. thus, I also can fit in the role of a completer-finisher.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?

If we need to rate how productive I am in a rage from 1  to 10, I will say a 8 in a normal day(without coming deadlines) but when there is an assignment to submit I can say I have a productivity of 10. of course, there are times when my mind collapses, or I overthink about a problem. I those case I can lose some time until I decide to change the techniques that I am using. 

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?

Normally, I decide to work first on the things that I must deliver first, only after that I can continue with other assignments or works that I must do. However, if there is a large project to develop, I need to start on time to not get any work behind schedule. It means I divide the time to make both works. 

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?

Usually, I make a plan of all steps that I need to do in order to complete a task or in this case the project, thus, I create a small schedule of what need to be done each day, always creating some extra time in case something causes a delay on my work. In this way I can make sure I have completed the project on time.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?

I am reserved person, so I do not interact to much within a meeting, however I interact when I have to, when there is a decision to take or there is some important to discuss.
To decide the task to do, it can be easy if there are some plans beforehand, otherwise it could take some time, 30-60 minutes. It will depend on how effective the communication between the members of the group is.
The meeting are more fluent when it is scheduled beforehand, and all the topics to discuss are planned. x	x

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?

As a group we need to plan all the features that our application will have, and stablish a base for what must be completed, additionally we can mention additional requirement that can be implemented after completing the basis. 
All the requirements can be considered as finished when it accomplishes their functionality correctly after testing.


## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
As a Team we need to be sure about the work we are doing. That is why is always important to ask for feedback of our teammates. Also, it is also important to take each feedback positively.
