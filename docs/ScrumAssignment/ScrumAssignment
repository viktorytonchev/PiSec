**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I find it difficult to assign me to a certain role. When I have the lead I am comfortable with having the overview and giving tasks, but I find myself sometimes working better with just receiving a certain task and than just focus on that.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
Im not the type of person who works in advance a lot, I just finish my parts/tasks before the deadline and if I seem to become to close I am capable of working really hard to get it done. Working best under pressure, but is probably not the best choice sometimes.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
As for the nearest deadline I will put the most effort in, because that comes earlier, but when I know a bigger assignment/test will come after soon, I will spread my work.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
I am present at all the meetings and I do like to plan some extra meetings, just so that everyone keeps up with what everyone's tasks are etc.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
Maybe be more precise in what we are doing at the meeting itself, so we can get through it more easy.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
Ask other people if they see something new is added to the idea were using, or how the 'new' product has impact on people's current ways of living or whatever the purpose is of the product. Just ask people, because you make it for them.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
I think that if you know what a collegues weak and strong points are you can better cooperate and work together in a project.
