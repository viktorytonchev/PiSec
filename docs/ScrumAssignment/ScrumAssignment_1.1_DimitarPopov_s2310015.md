**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
When it comes to roles, I would prefer the roles of and Implementer or a Specialist. I like the feeling of making the project implementation moving forward and I also have already done a Belbin role test last year which gave me these roles and they fit me quite well back then. I got liked what I did back then and my team even got a best project award. I also enjoy Co-ordinating but since the team is smaller than 9 members, there can be miltiple people taking that role and people taking more than one role.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
I can say that once I get into rhythm I can be pretty productive. When I have a plan to follow I can say I am can follow a certain structure and do a lot of work. When I make a plan for any task I usually estimate that I will be very productive. If my estimation turns out to be wrong I usually either work a bit overtime or I try to think of more efficient ways of doing my tasks.


## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
I usually prioritise my tasks based on deadlines and size. If the task is due soon or is a really small one, I usually do it first. If the task is big I try to fragment it into smaller workload pieces and do it alongside everything else that I have.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
I usually use a time managment program or use scrum when I am in a team. This really helps me staying on track, knowing what I have to work for the day and knowing my deadlines

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
In a meeting I try to be as talkative as possible - brainstorming and making a plan that everyone on the team is aware of is very important to me. The meetings take around 15-20 minutes but afterwards we try catch up and continue with some more planning and finish everything that was not completed and is nearly due in the plan or just take as much time as possible working on it. The only feedback I would give is make the meetings in Discord once again, since that is a much more stable and smooth experience.


## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
When we have an idea for a product we try thinking of all the different type of users possible. For every user we think of requirements they would have to suit their needs. Then we write down some requirements and take some time to think if new requirements. If there is an option for interview with a stakeholder we always take it as well. The requiremets list is labeled as complete once we've gathered as much requirements as possible.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
Yes, I think the evaluation is very important. Having a good idea of what you and your teammates are like is crucial for every team - in this way every memeber of the team can be assigned a role that truly fits them and the team as a whole can reach maximum productivity.
