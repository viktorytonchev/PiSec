**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I see myself as an implementer since I like to get things done. Once I have an idea I don't stop until I have completed it.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
When I know there is a coming deadline or a lot of work needs to be done I sit down and work as long as I need to. Sometimes I get distracted and don't do as much work as I could.
If my estimation goes wrong I crunch and work almost non-stop to catch up with it.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
First I do general tasks that are needed for everything else, then I make sure they work and tweak them if necessary, then I work on secondary tasks and finally on extra ones if there is time left.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
From a map with all tasks and epics created in the design phase.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
I talk when promted and sometimes take intiative on my own. I stay for the meetings as long as I need to.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
I think about what is needed for a final product and divide that matches the description and works as intended. A product is geniunely completed when all the requirements have been met and you have a
complete product that works properly.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
Evaluation is important because you need to know what to do to improve for the next assignment, sprint, project, etc. I assess myself and my colleagues by the amount of work done, the quality of it
and how much effort was wasted to do it.
