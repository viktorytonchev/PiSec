**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I would prefer working as a coordinator. I believe that I am good at working out how to spread out workload in a fair manner and assign the tasks required to be done depending on my team member's weaknesses. 
## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
I try to be as productive as possible in a reasonalable manner. However, I often find that I at my best when pressured by deadlines. I usually try to spread out my work so that I do not have to be overloaded with work in the end but if I don't I just focus only on my work and nothing else.
## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
I prioritize my tasks by looking at the nearest deadline and doing it first. My criteria is always to never start something else until I am finished with my current task.
## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
By looking at my deadlines and alwasy being due with them. If I find myself behind and in danger of missing a deadline I just work non-stop until I am finished.
## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
I try to give ideas or contribute in the discussions when I am able to as long as I am iterate on the topic. I cannot say definitively how long do I spend in a meeting because every meeting individually takes a different duration of time.
## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
I decide the requirments depending on the project. I prefer having a fully working system at the final deadline that fullfills all the basic requirments. It could have even more than expected but I would try not to overdo it. 
## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
It can be important for most teams but I do not think it would be effective for me and my current team. I believe that we have good insight and can evaluate our situation and progress without evaluations.
