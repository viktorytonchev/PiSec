We could have prepared the presentation better and more detailed.

We could have split our tasks before the presentation.

We knew we might be late to the scrum meeting, however we did not communicate that with the scrum mentor(Triet). Therefore we needed to reschedule the meeting last minute.
 
During the second week of the sprint we were focused on the exam and therefore did less progress on the project than expected. 

**Q3:** What did you learn during the last sprint on a….

**a)**   Domain specific level?

We got to know each other well and developed team spirit.

We determined the strengths and weaknesses of each team member and were able to distribute tasks accordingly.

We aren't only communicating related to the project, but we are also sharing our thoughts about topics unrelated to the project.

**Q4:** What are your plans for the next sprint?

Finish the UML diagrams.

Connect the sensor and try setting up the basic sensor operation.
 
Create the project mock up.
 
Set up the database.

**Q6:** Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?

Vladimirs - at the last moment remembered about an unfinished assignment and therefore the team was able to stay on track.

It is important to balance time between the project and other study subjects.

It is important to be focused during project meetings to allow maximum productivity.

It is important that every group member is not only aware of their part, but also is aware of the overall project progress.

It is important to be able to ask for help if such is needed, so that the progress of the project is steady.
