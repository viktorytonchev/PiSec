## 3. Strengths and Weaknesses (Mention at least 5)

* Members from different studies make a team with a diverse set of skills.
* Because the team members are from different studies, it takes a bit more time to get comfortable and efficient as a team.
* We were able to identify quickly which software we will be using to communicate and were able to communicate efficiently thereafter.

    Be on time, 
    Notify if you are unable or late,
    Be prepared.

    Listen carefully,
    Be involved.
* Problem Solving (What approach you follow to solve a project task?):
    Define problem,
    Generate ideas,

    Implement and  evaluate.
* Decision Making (How do you decide the number of project-related tasks and the team member  to complete the task? Elaborate)
    Each member states three of their best skills relevant to the task,
    Weigh the skills,
    Vote for team member for a task,
    Take action.

    Find a compromise.

    The team has not encountered any conflicts yet.
* Deadlock Situation (Who will you approach to continue the progress of your project due to a 
kind of disagreements within your team?)
    If there is a conflict, identify if there is a team member with a neutral opinion.
    They will need to decide which solution would be best for the team.

    If there isn't a neutral member, ask the Scrum Mentors for help in conflict resolution.
